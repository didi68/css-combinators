# css-combinators
This class is about combining selectors, which involves; group combination, child combination, combining combiners, chaining and descendant combination
This class on Angela Yu's Web Development BootCamp taught about combining Css in different ways, which include: group combining (this involves combining 2 selectors or class and separating them with a comma), child combination (it involves combining a parent and a child just a level deep and they separated with the right angle (>)), descendant combination (this involves an ancestor and a descendant, separated with a space), chaining (this involves putting the selectors without space and the elements must come first) and then the combining combiners (which involves the ancestor and the combined selectors).
